        <h2>üåü The Big Five in One Place</h2>
        <p>
            Kenya is one of the few places in the world where you can spot the
            iconic Big Five animals: lions, elephants, leopards, buffalos, and
            rhinos ‚Äî often in a single game drive. The legendary Maasai Mara,
            Amboseli, and Tsavo parks offer unmatched wildlife viewing.
        </p>

        <h2>üåÑ Witness the Great Migration</h2>
        <p>
            Experience the awe-inspiring Great Wildebeest Migration as over 1.5
            million animals cross the Mara River in search of greener pastures.
            It‚Äôs one of nature‚Äôs most dramatic spectacles.
        </p>

        <h2>üè® Authentic Safari Lodges</h2>
        <p>
            Stay in unique lodges and luxury camps that blend beautifully with
            the wilderness. Wake up to giraffes outside your window or dine
            under the stars with lions roaring in the distance.
        </p>

        <h2>üß≥Ô∏è Rich Cultural Encounters</h2>
        <p>
            Meet the Maasai, Samburu, and other local communities who have
            coexisted with wildlife for centuries. Learn about their customs,
            dance, and storytelling traditions.
        </p>

        <h2>‚òÄÔ∏è Ideal Weather Year-Round</h2>
        <p>
            Kenya enjoys warm days and cool evenings, perfect for early morning
            game drives and sunset safaris. The dry season (June to October)
            offers incredible wildlife visibility.
        </p>

        <p class="closing">
            Kenya isn‚Äôt just a destination. It‚Äôs an experience of wild beauty,
            warm people, and unforgettable memories. Your adventure starts here.
